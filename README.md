# Albacore-Landings
R code to fit  hurdle model and produce albacore landings projections

Code to fit a logistic model to albacore landings per vessel per port data from the US West Coast. 
A generalized additive model with a Gamma error distribution and a log-link is then fit to the non-zero landings per vessel data.
Finally projections of landings per vessel are generated informed by future projections of albacore availability over fishing grounds.
